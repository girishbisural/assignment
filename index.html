  <h1 id="heading">KOENIGSEGG GEMERA</h1>
  <div id="story">
    <p>The Gemera seats four large adults comfortably with space catering to their carry-on luggage, meaning the Koenigsegg megacar experience can be shared with family and friends. The notion behind Gemera’s name – a combination of the two Swedish words – “ge” (give) and “mera” (more) signifies “to give more”. A suitable name for a car that adds features and functions without taking away anything that makes it a true megacar.</p>
    <p>Since the birth of the company more than 25 years ago, Koenigsegg has been driven to create the ultimate performance car. Despite being a four-seater, the Gemera easily outperforms most two-seat megacars, both combustion and electric. Still, the focus of the Gemera is taking on long-range public roads – family trips, in comfort, style and safety with never-before-experienced performance.  With its 1.27 megawatts of power and 3500 Nm of torque, the Gemera goes from 0 to 100 km/h in 1.9 seconds and to 400 km/h in record matching pace. The Gemera comes with the most amazing sound from a 3-cylinder engine ever.</p>
    <p>The Gemera yields a combined power output of 1700 bhp or 1.27 MW. The three electrical motors – one for each rear wheel and one on the crankshaft of the engine have a combined output of 800 kW or 1100 bhp. The Gemera’s 2-liter 3-cylinder dry sumped twin-turbo Freevalve engine, named the Tiny Friendly Giant (or TFG for short) adds another 450 kW or 600 bhp.</p>
    <p>The TFG is a progressive outlook on the powertrains of tomorrow. The TFG offers a lighter, more efficient cradle-to-grave solution compared to any combustion engine before it. Combined with electrification, the Gemera can be argued to be cleaner than a long-range EV, by using next-generation combustion technology designed for next-generation renewable liquid fuels, together with a small battery plug-in electrification. The Gemera, if plugged in and filled with Gen 2.0 ethanol or CO2 neutral methanol like Vulcanol or any mix thereof, becomes at least as CO2 neutral as a pure electric car. Before these second-generation renewable fuel sources are more accessible, the Gemera can also be driven on E85 and in worst case normal petrol.</p>
